# AWS VPC automation with AWS Service Catalog

This project showcases one option how you could manage VPCs in an organisation. This is still very much a work in progress and will(hopefully) evolve.

Documentation should be here soon.

There might and most likely still are bugs in this sample so don't use in production.
